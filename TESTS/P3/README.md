This README describes how to run the tests for P3. 

List of Testing Scripts:
test-cd.csh
test-exec.csh
test-job-control.csh
test-pipe.csh


For example, to test your implementation of cd command, just type:

To see what commands are executed on your wsh in the tests, pass '-v' flag to the script. You would type: 

prompt> $ test-cd.csh -v
